<h2 align=center>Allowed functions</h2>
<p align=center>open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, access, dup,</p>
<p align=center>dup2, execve, exit, fork, pipe, unlink, wait, waitpid, ft_printf</p>
<h2>env</h2>
<p>When used in a pipeline, env is used to pass specific environment variables to a command or process in the pipeline, allowing it to access those values and use them in its execution.</p>
<h2 align=center>pipe()</h2>
<p>A pipe is a system call that creates a unidirectional communication link between two file descriptors</p>
<p>First process output on the stdout becomes the second process input on stdin</p>
<p>First process -> infile, second process -> outfile</p>
<h2 align=center>fork()</h2>
<p align=center>It's creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process).</p>
<p align=center>After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. A child process uses the same pc(program counter), same CPU registers, same open files which use in the parent process.</p>
<p align=center>Negative Value: creation of a child process was unsuccessful.<p>
<p align=center>Zero: Returned to the newly created child process.<p>
<p align=center>Positive value: Returned to parent or caller. The value contains process ID of newly created child process.<p>

_If you call fork() once:_

	|-----------|
	|  parent   |
	|___________|
		|
		|
	|-----------|
	|  child_1  |
	|___________|

_If you call fork() twice:_

	|-----------|
	|  parent   |-------------->|
	|___________|               |
		|                   |
		|                   |
	|-----------|       |-----------|
	|  child_1  |       |  child_2  |
	|___________|       |___________|
		|
		|
	|-----------|
	|  child_3  |       
	|___________|

_If you call fork() 3 times:_

	|-----------|       |-----------|
	|  child_4  |<------|  parent   |---------->|
	|___________|       |___________|           |

<h2>int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);</h2>
<p>Allocates for a new filedescriptor that refers to the old one</p>
<p>Uses the given FD specified in newfd</p>
<p>If it was open previously, it's closed before being reused and it is running automatically</p>
<p>Trying to use dup() and close() instead, could cause problems like, reuse of the fd between 2 proces</p>
